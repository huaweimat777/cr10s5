# Prusa_mk3s_firmware_for-CR10S_rebuilded
modified firmware to 500x500x500 mm i3 style printer

This is copy of Prusa mk3s firmware 3.10.0 modified and adopted to my rebuilt printer Creality CR10S5 to prusa style. 
STL files for printer are on Thingiverse:

Printer already prints, maybe some small changes and improvements are still needed, but generaly it works.
